# VaultBoy Notes Application (2019)

I began seriously developing my IT skills in 2019 when I took my first JavaScript course. This was the foundation of my journey into programming. My first major project was the VaultBoy Notes Application in 2019, where I applied the skills I was learning to create a functional and interactive web application.
